					Brazil is a 1985 British film directed by Terry Gilliam and written
					by Gilliam, Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard. British National Cinema by Sarah Street describes the

					describes it as a 'dystopian satire'. The film stars Jonathan Pryce and features Robert De Niro, Kim 
					Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm.<br><br>
					The film centres on Sam Lowry, 
					a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living a 
					life in a small apartment, set in a consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly 
					maintained (and rather whimsical) machines. Brazil's bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of the 
					government depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, except that it has a buffoonish, slapstick 
					quality and lacks a Big Brother figure.
